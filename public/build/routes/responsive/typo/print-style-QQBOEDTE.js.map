Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever\n          since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and\n          scrambled it to make a type specimen book.\n        </P>\n        <P borderClr=\"gray\">\n          It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into\n          electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was\n          popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets\n          containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop\n          publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem\n          Ipsum.\n        </P>\n        <P borderClr=\"red\">\n          Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It\n          has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making\n          it over 2000 years old.\n        </P>\n        <P borderClr=\"purple\">\n          Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in\n          Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,\n          from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in\n          classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.\n        </P>\n        <P borderClr=\"green\">\n          Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus\n          Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written\n          in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very\n          popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem\n          ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n        </P>\n      </Wrapper>\n      <hr />\n\n      <Book>\n        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>\n        <p>\n          Outside the space-warp chamber, Rizal's great green sun had already\n          set. Thick olive dusk eddied through the interplanetary transit\n          center. I swore under my breath and slammed shut the warp-hatch\n          switch.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Locking bars whispered back. The hatch revolved on its axis, slow as\n          an asteroid eroding. I threw another quick glance at my chrono. It\n          still read the same as before: six Earth hours more\u2026 six hours to\n          ferret out the truth or be forever reconditioned.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          \u2014Six hours, that is, if Controller Alfred Kruze didn't cut it shorter.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And if he did, Rizal might very well change status. Today, it was\n          billed as the FedGov's outermost bastion against the Kel. Tomorrow, it\n          could prove man's fatal flaw, the Achilles heel in our whole system of\n          defenses.\n        </p>\n        <p>In which case\u2014</p>\n        <p>Involuntarily, I shivered.</p>\n        <p>\u201CAgent Traynor\u2014?\u201D</p>\n        <p>\n          The voice came from the shadows. A dull, phlegmatic, tranquilized,\n          conditioned voice. I stopped short; turned fast. \u201CWho's asking?\u201D\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The man shrugged stolidly, not even picking up my tension. \u201CI'm a port\n          rep, Agent Traynor. Port rep second, that is\u2014\u201D\n        </p>\n        <p>\u201CSo who told you to come out here? Who said you should meet me?\u201D</p>\n        <p>\n          \u201COh\u2026\u201D A pause. \u201CWell, you see, there's this sigman, Agent Traynor. Up\n          in the Interworld Communications section. He had a regular 7-D\n          clearance report that a FedGov Security investigation agent was\n          warping in\u2014you have to file a 7-D on all warpings, you know, Agent\n          Traynor, on account of restrictives. So\u2014well, the rep first was out to\n          eat, so I just notified Rizal Security, just a routine report, and the\n          unit controller there, an Agent Gaylord, he said for me to meet you,\n          and\u2014\u201D\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I bit down hard and shifted my weight, both at once, wondering if a\n          broken jaw would interfere with the work of a port rep second.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Only then, all at once, I caught the unmistakable whish of a grav-car\n          sweeping in.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The lights hit us almost in the same instant. Two seconds later a man\n          who said he was Agent Gaylord was jumping down and locking wrists with\n          me in Rizal's traditional greeting.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Even that wrist-lock set my teeth on edge. It was too solid, too\n          stolid, too thorough a job of conditioning.\n        </p>\n        <p>Or was it maybe, just a trifle over-done?</p>\n      </Book>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nconst Wrapper = styled(\"div\", {\n  columns: \"2\",\n  columnGap: \"16px\",\n  padding: \"16px\",\n});\n\nconst P = styled(\"p\", {\n  border: \"3px solid\",\n  //   \"break-inside\": \"avoid\",\n\n  variants: {\n    borderClr: {\n      purple: { borderColor: \"$purple500\" },\n      red: { borderColor: \"$red500\" },\n      green: { borderColor: \"$green500\" },\n      blue: { borderColor: \"$blue500\" },\n      gray: { borderColor: \"$gray500\" },\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nconst Book = styled(\"main\", {\n  maxWidth: \"64rem\",\n  margin: \"32px auto\",\n  border: \"2px solid hsl(35deg 10% 40%)\",\n});\n"],
